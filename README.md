# Attention All I need

## Overview
This is a repository to re-implement the paper [Attention All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) using PyTorch.
The goal is to provide a clean and simple implementation of the Transformer model for educational purposes. The implementation is based on the original paper and follows the architecture described in the paper closely.
